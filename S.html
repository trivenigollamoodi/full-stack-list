    <p>The Spring Framework includes several modules that provide a range of services:
    Spring Core Container: this is the base module of Spring and provides spring containers (BeanFactory and ApplicationContext).In this context, spring-core is the artifact found in the core module belonging to the org.springframework group.The spring-core artifact consists of the IoC container, as well as the utility classes used throughout the application.Aspect-oriented programming: enables implementing cross-cutting concerns.The spring-aop is an artifact for the AOP framework.
    Authentication and authorization: configurable security processes that support a range of standards, protocols, tools and practices via the Spring Security sub-project (formerly Acegi Security System for Spring).Convention over configuration: a rapid application development solution for Spring-based enterprise applications is offered in the Spring Roo module.Data access: working with relational database management systems on the Java platform using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)and object-relational mapping tools and with NoSQL databases. The spring-jdbc is an artifact found in the JDBC module which supports JDBC access by including datasource setup classes.Inversion of control container: configuration of application components and lifecycle management of Java objects, done mainly via dependency injection.Messaging: declarative registration of message listener objects for transparent message-consumption from message queues via Java Message Service (JMS), improvement of message sending over standard JMS APIs.
    Model ontroller: an HTTP- and servlet-based framework providing hooks for extension and customization for web applications and RESTful (representational state transfer) Web services.Remote access framework: declarative remote procedure call (RPC)-style marshalling of Java objects over networks supporting Java remote method invocation (RMI), CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and HTTP-based protocols including Web services such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).Transaction management: unifies several transaction management APIs and coordinates transactions for Java objects.
    Remote management: declarative exposure and management of Java objects for local or remote configuration via Java Management Extensions (JMX).Testing: support classes for writing unit tests and integration tests.WebFlux support: support for using reactive runtimes or web servers such as UnderTow and Netty.Web Socket support: Support for communicating using the WebSocket protocol. The artifact for this module is spring-websocketXML support: support for object-toXML mapping. Libraries such as Jakarta XML Binding(JAXB) and XStream are supported. The artifact for this module is spring-oxm.
    Spring modules are packaged as JAR files.These artifacts can be accessed via the Maven Central Repository using Maven or Gradle.</p>
